AOPbot visualizer is an complementry tool with AOPbot which is an Text Mining tool that is specifically designed for the development of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs). It is being actively developed as part of the [**Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) project**](https://www.eu-parc.eu). AOPs are important conceptual frameworks used in toxicology and risk assessment to understand the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms. AOPbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract valuable information from scientific literature and other relevant sources. It assists researchers and domain experts in the identification, extraction, and analysis of key components of AOPs, such as molecular initiating events, intermediate events, and adverse outcomes.
